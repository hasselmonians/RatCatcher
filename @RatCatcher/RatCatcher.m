classdef RatCatcher

properties

  filenames
  % cell array of character vectors
  % a list of all filenames of the raw data to be processed
  % note that these could be folders which unambiguously specify an experiment
  % since some experiments produce multiple data files (e.g. a video and time series data)

  filecodes
  % numerical matrix of size n x 2 where n = length(filenames)
  % stores any additional parameters required to unambiguously specific data
  % from one of the filenames

  expID
  % character vector or cell array of character vectors
  % an unambiguous identifier that identifies the raw data
  % it serves as a code to the |parse| function
  % the columns are increasingly specific IDs to the parse function
  % the rows are new IDS (results are appended)

  remotePath
  % character vector
  % absolute path to where the output data should be stored on a computing cluster

  localPath
  % character vector
  % absolute path to where the output data should be stored on a local computer

  protocol
  % character vector
  % the name of the analysis protocol to be performed on the cluster
  % this is used to find the correct batchFunction

  project
  % character vector
  % the name of the project paying for compute nodes on the cluster
