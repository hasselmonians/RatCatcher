classdef RatCatcher

properties

  expID
  % character vector or cell array of character vectors
  % cannot be a character matrix
  % an unambiguous identifier that identifies the raw data
  % it serves as a code to the `parse` function
  % the columns are increasingly specific IDs to the parse function
  % the rows are new IDs (results are appended)

  remotepath
  % character vector
  % absolute path to where the output data should be stored on a computing cluster

  localpath
  % character vector
  % absolute path to where the output data should be stored on a local computer

  protocol
  % character vector
  % the name of the analysis protocol to be performed on the cluster
  % this is used to find the correct batchFunction

  project
  % character vector
  % the name of the project paying for compute nodes on the cluster

  batchname
  % the unique identifier which is part of every file name for files created by RatCatcher

  filenames
  % m x 1 cell array of character vectors
  % the list of files names of raw data to be processed via the batch function

  filecodes
  % a matrix of size m x n, where m is the number of filenames
  % contains numerical information used to find specific data inside of the paired filename

  batchfuncpath
  % character vector
  % the full path to the batch function
  % used to select the correct batch function during batchifying

  batchscriptpath
  % character vector
  % the full path to the batch script
  % used to select the correct batch script during batchifying

  verbose
  % logical
  % if true, functions output more descriptive text while running

methods (Static)
